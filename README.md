# EEG-Denoising
Electroencephalography Data Denoising With Deep Neural Networks 

Abstract— The application of electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used in studies including neuroscience, neural engineering, and biomedical engineering because of its advantages such as non invasiveness, high temporal resolution, and relatively low financial cost. However, the raw EEG data are frequently contaminated by physiological artifacts and numerous noises, such as cardiac artifacts, myogenic artifacts, and ocular artifacts. Existing deep learning-based EEG signal denoising methods can be used to weaken or remove the negative influence of artifacts. However, they usually suffer from the degradation problem of denoising performance when the received EEG data have severe artifacts. To address this issue, we proposed 2x3R-CNN and compared with four deep learning-based approaches namely fully connected neural network (FCNN), simple convolution network (simple CNN), complex convolution network (complex CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) to remove muscle and ocular artifacts from EEG signal. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the existed methods on the EEGdenoiseNet dataset.

The model was implemented using Python 3.8 with the PyTorch library.
